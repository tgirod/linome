This program aims to reproduce the behaviour of monome's serialosc, but with a
launchpad instead.

The goal is to expose a very monome like OSC API, and extend it with launchpad
specific elements : red/green leds with variable intensity, scene and control
buttons ...

The launchpad's micro-contoller uses a degraded mode for USB communication,
with very poor bandwidth. Moreover, the protocol used by the launchpad in order
to communicate with the computer is poorly designed. The result is a crappy
refresh rate.

In order to mitigate the problem, linome exploits two functionnalities of the
launchpad: **fast led update** and **double buffering**. The first allows us to
update the 80 RG leds of the launchpad in one batch, doing it with 81 bytes
instead of 240. The second allows us to send our 81 bytes of LED data, then
update the 80 LEDs all at once.

# OSC API

The reference implementation: http://monome.org/docs/tech:osc

Implemented:

- `/sys/host s`: set the destination host for OSC messages
- `/sys/port i`: set the destination port for OSC messages
- `/grid/led/set x y s`
- `/grid/led/all s`

Launchpad specific:

- `/scene/led/set y s`
- `/scene/led/all s`
- `/ctrl/led/set x s`
- `/ctrl/led/all s`

# Troubleshooting

- unless you have set the permissions properly, this program needs to run as
  root in order to access the launchpad in rw mode.
- when the launchpad is connected, alsa automatically claims the device,
  preventing linome to claim it. Right now, the only solution I found to this
  problem is to run `modprobe -r snd-usb-audio` to kick alsa out of the way.
